;   Check devices: 
;     ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/

; Comment out or leave empty if you want to detect all automatically

; Set the measurement unit the sensor outputs: C (Celcius), F (Farenheit), K (Kelvin)
; This does -not- convert the value from the sensor.

; Set the number of times to request successful data from the sensor.
; The output will be the average from all the requests provided.
; The sensors seems to be very stable and thus it's usually enough with just '1' request.
; Less is also faster.
